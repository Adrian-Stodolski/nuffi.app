# Technology Stack

## Development Environment
- **IDE**: VSCode with Kiro AI assistant integration
- **AI Assistant**: Kiro with Model Context Protocol (MCP) support
- **Platform**: Cross-platform development environment

## Configuration
- Kiro MCP integration is enabled via VSCode settings
- Steering rules located in `.kiro/steering/` for AI guidance
- VSCode workspace configuration in `.vscode/settings.json`

## Common Commands
Since this is a foundational workspace, specific build/test commands will depend on the project type being developed. Common patterns include:

### For Node.js projects:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
```

### For Python projects:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
python main.py
```

### For general development:
```bash
# Use Kiro for code assistance
# Access MCP tools through Kiro interface
# Leverage steering rules for consistent development patterns
```

## Best Practices
- Utilize Kiro's AI capabilities for code generation and analysis
- Follow steering rules defined in `.kiro/steering/` directory
- Maintain clean workspace organization for optimal AI assistance
